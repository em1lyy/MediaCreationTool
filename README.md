# MediaCreationTool  
A simple, OS-Independent Media Creation Tool.  

## What it does:  
1. It checks whether to download from a main URL or from a mirror.  
2. It downloads the ISO file.  
3. It validates the ISO with an MD5 hash.  
4. It formats the USB/DVD.  
5. It burns the ISO to the USB/DVD.  
  
## Real Cross-Platform  
The JaguDev Media Creation Tool implements two different kinds of Cross-Platform:
* You can't just use it to create GNU/Linux Boot Media, you can literally use it for every OS you've got an ISO Image of.  
* It runs on every common OS: GNU/Linux, Windows And macOS.
